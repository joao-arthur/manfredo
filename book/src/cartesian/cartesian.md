# Cartesian Plane

Represents space using perpendicular axes, **X** and **Y** in _2D_, where `(0, 0)` lies at the intersection of the axes.

Each point is described as an ordered pair `(x, y)`. Both coordinates can be **positive or negative**, and may represent either **continuous** (floating-point) or **discrete** (integer) positions.

## Direction

- **+X** → right
- **-X** → left
- **+Y** → up
- **-Y** → down

### Use Case

Working with **geometric space** or **objects that move freely** in any direction. The origin `(0, 0)` is just a reference point, not a constraint. Example:

- Conway's Game Of life grid
- 2D game camera
- Physics simulations
