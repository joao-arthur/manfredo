# Transform

In some cases, it is necessary to convert a point between the **Cartesian plane** and the **Matrix
plane**. This process is called a **coordinate transform**.

There are two main variations of this operation:

## Absolute Conversion

The bounds of the type are considered.

## Relative Conversion

A camera is used as the bounds.
